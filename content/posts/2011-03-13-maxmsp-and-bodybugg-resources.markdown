title: Max/MSP and Bodybugg Resources

Here's a couple of resources I've found over the past week that've
been helpful:

[Cycling '74][1] has recently added a
[gear forum to their user forums][2], for support of hardware
externals for Max/MSP. I [maintain a few externals][3] for biometrics
and health hardware, and plan on using these forums for support and
further requests.

Note that there's also the [openyou google groups][4] that I'm using
for general discussion of hardware/software, though Max/Pd discussion
on health programming is more that welcome there too.

I also started doing some research on the [BodyBugg][5] today, just to
see if any libraries exist for it yet. It looks like
[someone started a project to reverse engineering their data][4] a
couple of years ago, but it seems to have stalled. There's some python
code that was posted to a mediafire account, which I've downloaded and
put on a github repo at

[https://github.com/qdot/libbodybugg][6]

I don't currently have a bodybugg and I'm 3 deep in reverse
engineering projects right now, so this is more a note for future
reference, or for anyone else that's looking for bodybugg
libraries. I'll be adding this to the libraries page once I get some
time.
