After making it to the [San Francisco Quantified Self meetup][1] last
week, it became obvious how silly it would be to not show up to the
[Quantified Self conference in May][2]. So, we'll be there with whatever
hardware we can drag along. Looking forward to meeting people and
talking about what can be done with new hardware!
