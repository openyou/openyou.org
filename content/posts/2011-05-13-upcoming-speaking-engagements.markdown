This summer is shaping up to be a busy one...

I'm speaking at [Maker Faire][1]. Twice, even!

- 2011-05-21 3:30pm - [OpenYou.org][5] Presentation, Health 2.0 Stage
- 2011-05-21 6:00pm - [OpenKinect][3] Presentation, Main Stage

Then there's the [Quantified Self Conference][2] on May 28-29th,
2011, at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, CA. There's no
central presentation, but honestly, I probably won't stop talking at
any point during the 2 days, as I have a table at the expo, plus will
be helping out with the health hardware session and the hackathon.

On June 23rd, I'll be doing a presentation on the [OpenKinect][3]
project at [NetExplorateur Zoom 2011][4] in Paris.
