title: OpenYou.org Mailing List and IRC channel
date: 2011-02-25 23:55:09 -08:00

I've put together a google groups mailing list to talk about
development of open source health hardware/software and drivers for
consumer health equipment. It's at

[https://groups.google.com/group/openyou/][1]

Also, we've got an IRC channel on Freenode, #openyou. If you don't
have an irc client currently, you can use [freenode's web client][2]
to get there for now.
