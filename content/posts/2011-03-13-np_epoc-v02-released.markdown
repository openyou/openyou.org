v0.2 of the [np_epoc external for Max/MSP and Pd][3] has been released.

VID/PID and key are now selectable by users. Users can also get a
device count to make sure the VID/PID pair is set up correctly.

Hopefully key and ID detection will be done by [emokit][1] soon, but
that's going to take a little more work since we're not yet sure how
the key is deduced on connection.

[Binaries are available on the sourceforge NP Labs release site.][2]
