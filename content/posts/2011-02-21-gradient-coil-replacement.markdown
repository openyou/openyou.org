title: MRI Gradient Coil Replacement
date: 2011-02-21 22:11:09 -08:00

Earlier this week, I was invited to check out an MRI as it was being
dismantled for replacement of the [gradient coil][1]. It's rare to see
an MRI in this state outside of the factory, so I crutched myself down
to the [UCSF Neuroimaging Lab][2] to check it out.

The gradient coil itself is a big cylinder of wire that weighs about
3000 pounds. It's an integral part of providing positioning of signals
coming from whatever is being scanned (which, in this case, is usually
brains.)

Replacing it is not exactly a simple task. The coil had to be rolled
along a large metal bar and lined up precisely with the opening of the
MRI, as it is seated very tightly. Here's video of the installation:

There were many other interesting pieces of hardware around the
lab. [Dr. Adam Gazzaley][3] is currently doing
[a study on the brain and multitasking via video games][6], and needs
to have a rig capable of playing video games in the room with the
MRI. As there's a 3 tesla sitting in the middle of the room while the
games are being played, this means convention hardware using magnetic
materials is right out. This means there's specially built hardware
all around, including specially built, heavily shielded LCD monitors
using no magnetic materials.

Thanks to [Dr. Gazzaley][3] and [Dr. Stables][2] for inviting
me to the lab and showing me around!
