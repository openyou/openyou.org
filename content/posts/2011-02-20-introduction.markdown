Obviously, there should probably be some snazzy graphics or a blog
or something here. However, I've been pretty busy putting together the
[libfitbit](http://www.github.com/openyou/libfitbit/) 
library, which means I'm a bit behind on logos and design. Anyways,
this will soon be a clearinghouse for open source libraries for health
and sports hardware from places like:

* Omron ([libomron](http://www.github.com/qdot/libomron) - Currently supports pedometer and bp monitor)
* Wild Divine ([liblightstone](http://www.github.com/qdot/liblightstone) - Currently supports old lightstone, working on support for new)
* Suunto
* Garmin
* Fitbit ([libfitbit](http://www.github.com/qdot/libfitbit) currently in development)

And any other place that has interesting hardware that we feel like
reverse engineering. If you'd like to help out, or have a library
you've already worked on or open source health blog that you'd like
linked to from here, please get in touch with me at *kyle at openyou
dot org*
