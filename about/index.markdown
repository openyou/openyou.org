## About The Site ##

OpenYou.org seeks to be a central resource for news about open source
development on health hardware. It provides lists of libraries and
applications from the open source community, to help developers learn
more about the devices that let them learn about themselves.

In addition to pointing to other libraries and projects, the OpenYou
team also actively reverse engineers and develops drivers and
libraries for whatever health hardware they can find.
