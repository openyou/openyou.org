Contrary to evidence otherwise, I'm not dead, just got busy with life
outside blog/qs land for the past 8 months. Am now working on
returning to former productivity levels, starting with a new release
of emokit and openvibe bindings ASAP, then maybe taking another look
at libfitbit and the fitbit ultra.

Before that's all done though, I'll be speaking at the
[SF Data Mining Meetup][1] March 6th at the Trulia offices. It's me
and one of the people from [Basis][2]. I think it may already be sold
out, but watch the page to see if more spots become open.
