Earlier this week, I spoke at Google I/O on OpenYou and The Quantified
Coder Project, one of the first "things I can do with all of the
hardware I'm working on for OpenYou"
projects. [The talk is now available on YouTube][1].

(if it doesn't happen automatically, wind above to 12:47 for the start
of my talk, though the whole thing is a great watch if you've got the
time, as there are lots of QSy topics in it)

For those interested in the talk content,
[the slides and notes are available as a zip file][2].

As I've been working on sensors for OpenYou, I've been coming up with
different ideas about what to do with all of this data once I've got
it. Having an end goal for these projects keeps me motivated while I'm
in the bit mines. What's I've come up with so far:

* [Golden Gate Wall][3] - Rock climbing is a big new hobby for me
  (only been at it about a year), and seems like a neat place to think
  about engineering. There's already some [neat research papers][5],
  for instance. I figured I'd 3D scan a rock climbing wall in
  Berkeley, CA, and start mapping information about it. Looking to do
  things like automated route planning based on past traversal by
  climbers who are wearing sensors, maybe doing some infoviz on the
  biometrics, etc...
* [Quantified Coder][4] - In looking at accessing all of this
  hardware, I have to think about where I'm gonna be most of the time,
  and what I can do with the data from that time. Mostly, it's gonna
  be spent in front of the computer. So, why not try and make it add
  value to what I'm doing, like programming? That's what quantified
  coder is about. For now, check out the talk above for a more
  in-depth explanation of where I see it going.

Right now, my main goal with OpenYou is to get the community moving,
adding a wiki for protocol information, and getting a few of the
driver projects to version 1. I've done information
gathering/centralization projects like this before (for instance, with
the Compaq IA-1 Internet Appliance, many years ago), but they tend to
lose focus if there's not a goal outside of that. The projects above
give this procedure some shape, which will hopefully means I can keep
on-going interest and attention as everything progresses.

So, in conclusion, yes, OpenYou is a my very own meta-quantified-self
project. Nice that things work out like that sometimes.
