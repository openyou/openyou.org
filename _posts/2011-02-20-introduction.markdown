Obviously, there should probably be some snazzy graphics or a blog
or something here. However, I've been pretty busy putting together the
<A HREF='http://www.github.com/openyou/libfitbit/'>libfitbit</A> 
library, which means I'm a bit behind on logos and design. Anyways,
this will soon be a clearinghouse for open source libraries for health
and sports hardware from places like:

	
* Omron (<A HREF='http://www.github.com/qdot/libomron'>libomron</A> - Currently supports pedometer and bp monitor)
* Wild Divine (<A HREF='http://www.github.com/qdot/liblightstone'>liblightstone</A> - Currently supports old lightstone, working on support for new)
* Suunto
* Garmin
* Fitbit (<A HREF='http://www.github.com/openyou/libfitbit'>libfitbit</A> currently in development)


And any other place that has interesting hardware that we feel like
reverse engineering. If you'd like to help out, or have a library
you've already worked on or open source health blog that you'd like
linked to from here, please get in touch with me at *kyle at openyou
dot org*
